# Mirrorcle-MEMS-Lens-Conrtrol-basic-function
A simple Mirrrorcle MEMS lens control files, including some function initilaize the ADC of MEMS lens dirver and control voltage output.
The mainly function included in the file "MEMS_Control_Functions".
"GUI_Main" is a GUI interface designed for controlling the deflection angle of a MEMS lens in real-time.
"tracking_test" is a demo of KalmanFilter_based MEMS tracking system.
MEMS lens come from Mirrorcle tech and the dirver manual is uploaded.
